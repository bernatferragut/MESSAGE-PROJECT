This project presents 9 pieces of ART reflecting my personal research on the constant suffering condition of the human being in the past, present and future. The content is presented through the message content received in an OBE at a young age and how this message helps us and gives us direction in how to live a better life as human beings in this world.

a. ACTIVITIES & ARTISTIC CHOICES
The Project involves the creation of 9 Pieces of Art subdivided into 3 groups + 1.

The message received through an OBE altered state of consciousness

0. The Message 
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Web VR
> Projection over a massive big cylinder in the exhibit center
. The origins of the OOB experience and the message

The first group relates to the relationship between the cylinder and *SACRED ART*
Here we show the original message and its relationship with historical influences like the Egyptian, Esoteric and Alchemical arts.

1. The physics of a cylinder Digital
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Robotics and IOT
. The main focus of the exhibition: decoding the meaning of the cylinder
2. Polarity Battles
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - 3D Printing
. Greed + Fear vs Love + Compassion
3. The Past - Egyptians
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
. The cylinder under the Egyptian culture

The second group relates to *RELIGION*. 
Here we show the inspiration and relationships of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist Religions relating to the presented 3 pieces of Art.

4. Christianity
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
. Christian symbology and the cylindrical relationship
5. Jewish
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
Jewish symbology and the cylindrical relationship
6. Buddhism
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
Buddhist symbology and the cylindrical relationship

The third group relates to the *PHYSICAL REALITY*
Here we show how the Art received behaves in the physical world. How affects us and how present is in our everyday life.

7. Today's life
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
. The cylinder in today's daily life
8. The modern Database
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Blockchain technology
. The cylindrical structure of today's Databases
9. The Market
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
. The Fear and Greed Index of the Capital Markets today

b. INSPIRATION OF THE CREATIVE WORK
The inspiration for the work comes from a deeply transformative experience I had when I was 18-19 years old. The so-called 'Kundalini Experience' allowed me to have a natural OBE (Out of the body experience) and attain higher states of consciousness. 

After this event, my life did change forever and the messages received during this deep dive into a consciousness mark the beginning of a series of exhibitions which will describe through art such experiences and in the process decode the messages received to give to the general public good.

c. WORK SHOW: WHEN AND WHERE

Because the Project objective is to share the information received after attaining/traveling to higher dimensions we envision to share it in old and modern sacred spaces:

. Old traditional sacred spaces - Churches and Cathedrals
. New modern sacred spaces - Yoga centers and specific and selected art galleries
. Natural Sacred spaces - Old Indigenous spaces in Quebec and Canada.

9. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES - 250 words :
. CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT?
This work is capital to my artistic development because it's my most personal up to date. Coming from a deep experience within when I was a young adult, 20 years after nothing has changed. I still remember that experience as it was today. 

My artistic style has been always marked by a deep spiritual imprint. And this imprint has pushed me to the study of the main world religions from the East and West. Bringing this work to live will only make me a better artist with a clearer and remarkable personality and style.

This work expresses my deepest mystical, religious and metaphysical experiences and it's vital for me as an artist start exploring this period of my life who supports my energy as an artist and brings a positive message to the masses.

. ADVANCE ARTISTIC PRACTICE?
- It will deepen my knowledge in the following artistic disciplines:
1. Web Programming 
2. Generative Art Coding
3. Digital Printing latest technologies including 3D Printing
4. Web Virtual Reality
5. Robotics and the Internet of Things
6. Blockchain technology and crypto identity
6. Meditative practices of visualization

. WHAT TYPE OF ARTISTIC RISKS WILL YOU BE TAKING?
I will offer several ways to experience the artwork:
- Latest digital Printing in medium and large format
- 3D Printing
- Creation of a mini IOT Robot

EXPLORING A TRADITIONAL PRACTICE IN A NEW WAY
- The website with coded Generative art pieces inspired by the main exhibit ones
- VR version of some of the pieces

TECHNOLOGY IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY
- Creation of a Mini IOT Robot for one of the pieces

 NEW MODELS OF DISSEMINATION
 - Digital citizenship with a unique cryptographical identity number bringing individual copyright to the market through Blockchain technology. 
- Introduction of the pieces into the new decentralized blockchain Market

10. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES BUILD INTEREST IN AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE? ARE YOUR ACTIVITIES TARGETED TO A SPECIFIC PUBLIC?

My project goes in the lines of contemporary artist who are opening a new medium which is metaphysical and trascendental at the same time. Visionaries like Alex Grey,and Adolph Turner opened a connection to other artsits who have experienced other worlds with artifical altered states or natural ones like is my case. 

Exist a bigger and bigger community of individuals who care for a better health, a better environment and a better and deeper human relationship. All these individual who are reointroducing to their daily lives ancient techniques like Yoga and Meditation are the public that can be supportive at first sight. 

At the same time the Project, although coming from the Metaphysics, dives into modern contemporary art world and puts itself at the for front of new web technologies like webVR, generative art and the use of modern blockchain technologies for the backend encrypted records. This will atract also the classic contemporary art based in new technologies.

11. IF YOU ARE HIRING ARTISTS, EXPLAIN HOW YOU DETERMINE THE FEES TO BE PAID 
- 250 words - See if I want to introduce this part or...not. All by myself?

I will hire an artist who will help me to build:

1- Mini IOT robot - I could build it just in code and in p5js or webVR
2- Massive Cylinder in the Center - I can look for support to project Holographic images inside a Cylinder.

His fees will be 25$/h and will work in paralel with me during 6 months

12. HOW WILL ENSURE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS? - 100 words
In his case he has a lab and is professional in physics 

13. DOES NOT TOUCH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DIRECTLY BUT COULD BE PRESENTED IN ONE OF THEIR SITES

14. DISTRIBUTION - EXHIBITION - DISSEMINATION - PROMOTION - PLANS

15. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE?

1- EOS tokens to use the super decenteralized computer
2- Technology to Project in 3D
3- Programming skills

16. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY OF YOUR PROJECT - 25 words
