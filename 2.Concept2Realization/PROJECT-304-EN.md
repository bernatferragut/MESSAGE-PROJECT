The project presents 10 pieces of media ART reflecting my personal understanding over a series of 
'Out of the Body Experiences'/OBE I had at a young age. These experiences changed my life and inpired me 
to express myself through the art as a medium in my adulthood.

The 10 pieces of art show the audience my personal interpretations of these deep OBE experiences. In my conclusions I deal with polar conepts like physical / metaphisical,  consciouss / uncounsciouss and the nature of love and suffering. The exhibition proposes the human soul deathless and it's  consequences and responsabities while being alive in this world.

a. ACTIVITIES & ARTISTIC CHOICES
The Project involves the creation of 10 Pieces of Art subdivided into 4 groups.

* The first group is the message received through an OBE altered state of consciousness.

1. The Message 
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
> 3D LES's light cylinder at the exhibit center
. The origins of the OBE experience and it's message where the *'CYLINDRICAL SHAPE'* 
plays a central role and most of the exhibition will evolve around the significance of this geometrical shape.

* The second group relates to my personal conclusions after living these transformative experiences, 
and it is subdivided into 3 parts.

We show the relationship between the 'cylindrical shape' and *SACRED ART*.
It's relationship with historical influences like the Egyptian, Esoteric and Alchemical arts.

2. The physics of the 'cylindrical shape'
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: decoding the meaning of the 'cylinder'.
3. Polarity Battles
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: relationship between Greed / Fear and Love / Compassion.
4. The Past - Egyptians
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: The cylinder under the Egyptian culture.

The third group relates to *RELIGION* as we know it. 
We show the relationships and interconnections between Jewish-Christian, Buddhist and Hindu Faiths.

5. Judeo-Christian
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art 
. Focus of this artwork: Christian symbology and it's cylindrical relationship
6. Buddhist
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: Buddhist symbology and it's cylindrical relationship
7. Hundu
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: Hindu symbology and it's cylindrical relationship

The third group relates to the *PHYSICAL REALITY*.
We show how the cylindrical shape appears and behaves in our everyday life.

8. Today's life
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art
. Focus of this artwork: The cylinder in today's daily life
9. The modern Database
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Blockchain technology
. Focus of this artwork: The cylindrical structure in today's Digital Databases
10. The Market
> medium: Digital Print - Web Generative Art 
. Focus of this artwork: The Fear and Greed Index of the Capital Markets today

b. INSPIRATION OF THE CREATIVE WORK
The inspiration for the work comes from a deeply transformative experience I had when I was 18-19 years old. The so-called 'Kundalini Experience' allowed me to have a natural OBE (Out of the body experience) and attain higher states of consciousness. 

After this event, my life did change forever and the messages received during this deep dive into consciousness marked the beginning of a series of exhibitions which will describe through art such experiences in the following years. The intention is to decode the messages received and transmit them to the general public for good.

c. WORK SHOW: WHEN AND WHERE

Because the Project objective is to share the information received after attaining/traveling to higher dimensions we envision to share it in old and modern sacred spaces:

. Old traditional sacred spaces - Churches and Cathedrals
. New modern sacred spaces - Yoga centers and specific and selected art galleries
. Natural Sacred spaces - Old Indigenous spaces in Quebec and Canada.

9. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES - 250 words :
. CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT?
This work is capital to my artistic development because it's my most personal up to date. Coming from a profundly deep experience when I was a young adult, 20 years after nothing has changed. I still remember this experience as it were today. 

My artistic style has been always marked by a deep spiritual impression. This vision has pushed me to the study of the main world religions from the East and West. Bringing this work to life will only make me a better artist with a clearer vision and style.

This work expresses my deepest mystical, religious and metaphysical experiences and it's vital for me as an artist start exploring this lifechanging period of my life which inspires me to bring a positive message to the public: The possibility of an afterlife and its implications. ( 'Is death a myth?' )

. ADVANCE ARTISTIC PRACTICE?
- It will deepen my knowledge in the following artistic disciplines:
1. Modern Web Programming
2. Generative Art Coding
3. Digital Printing latest technologies
4. Digital rights stored in the Blockchain - Web 3.0
6. Meditative practices of visualization

. WHAT TYPE OF ARTISTIC RISKS WILL YOU BE TAKING?
I will offer several ways to experience the artwork:
- Latest digital Printing in medium and large format
- LED's Sculpture production
- Web 3.0 / Blockchain technology digital rights storage

EXPLORING A TRADITIONAL PRACTICE IN A NEW WAY / INNOVATIVE WAY
- Coding Generative art pieces inspired by the main printed ones
- LED's Hardware building and software Programming
- Decentralized storage of Data in the EOS.io Blockchain

 NEW MODELS OF DISSEMINATION
 - Digital citizenship with a unique cryptographical identity number bringing individual copyright to the market through the Blockchain technology. 
- Introduction of the art-work into the new decentralized blockchain Market

10. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES BUILD INTEREST IN AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE? ARE YOUR ACTIVITIES TARGETED TO A SPECIFIC PUBLIC?

My project goes in the lines of contemporary artist who are opening a new medium which is metaphysical and trascendental at the same time. Visionaries like Alex Grey and Adolph Turner opened the doors to other artsits who have experienced other worlds with artifical altered states or natural ones like is my case. This is positive and transformative art which aims to heal and transform.

Exist a bigger and bigger community of individuals who care for a better health, a better environment and a better and deeper human relationship. All these individual who are reintroducing to their daily lives ancient techniques like Yoga and Meditation are the public that can be supportive at first sight. 

At the same time the Project, although coming from the Metaphysics, dives into modern contemporary art world and puts itself at the forefront of new web technologies like Web Generative Art and the use of modern Blockchain technologies for the backend encrypted records. This will atract also the interest of contemporary public who connect with the latest new technologies.

11. IF YOU ARE HIRING ARTISTS, EXPLAIN HOW YOU DETERMINE THE FEES TO BE PAID 
- 250 words - See if I want to introduce this part or...not. All by myself?

14. DISTRIBUTION - EXHIBITION - DISSEMINATION - PROMOTION - PLANS

The project will be hosted on the new web 3.0 stored on the EOS Blockchain in a descentralized way. Each of the pieces will be ecrypted and sold in crytpocurrencies as payment method. The payments and shipping will be handled through the website. 

It will be promoted throught the SAT, GESU and other known Montreal Art Centers. 

My intention is to do the presentation in a church when possible and have a permanent exhibition there and another rotating different churches in Quebec, Canada and the World.
