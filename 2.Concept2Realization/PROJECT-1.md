The project presents 10 pieces of media ART reflecting my personal understanding over a series of 
'Out of the Body Experiences' - OBE I had at a young age. These experiences changed my life and gave me the vision and call to express myself through the art as a medium.

The conclusions presented through these 10 pieces of art propose to the audience a new direction and light in how to live a better life as human beings. The exhibition opens the possibility of the immortality of the human soul and it's  consequences while being alive in this world.

a. ACTIVITIES & ARTISTIC CHOICES
The Project involves the creation of 10 Pieces of Art subdivided into 4 groups.

The first is the message received through an OBE altered state of consciousness.

1. The Message 
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Web VR
> Holographic/VR cylindrical projection at the exhibit center
. The origins of the OBE experience and it's message where the *'CYLINDRICAL SHAPE'* it's central.

The second group relates to my personal conclusions after living these transformative experiences, 
and it is subdivided into 3 parts.

We show the relationship between the 'cylindrical shape', the *SACRED ART* and its relationship with historical influences like the Egyptian, Esoteric and Alchemical arts.

2. The physics of the 'cylindrical shape'
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Robotics and IOT?
. Focus of this artwork: decoding the meaning of the 'cylinder'.
3. Polarity Battles
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - 3D Printing
. Focus of this artwork: relationship between Greed and Fear against Love and Compassion.
4. The Past - Egyptians
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
. Focus of this artwork: The cylinder under the Egyptian culture.

The third group relates to *RELIGION* as we know it. 
We show the inspiration, relationships and interconnections of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist Faiths 
relating to the 3 pieces of Art presented.

5. Christianity
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
. Focus of this artwork: Christian symbology and it's cylindrical relationship
6. Jewish
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
. Focus of this artwork: Jewish symbology and it's cylindrical relationship
7. Buddhism
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
. Focus of this artwork: Buddhist symbology and it's cylindrical relationship

The third group relates to the *PHYSICAL REALITY*
Here we show how the information recieved behaves in the physical world. 
How affects us and how it's presented in our everyday life.

8. Today's life
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience
. Focus of this artwork: The cylinder in today's daily life
9. The modern Database
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience - Blockchain technology
. Focus of this artwork: The cylindrical structure in today's Digital Databases
10. The Market
> medium: Digital Print and Web experience 
. Focus of this artwork: The Fear and Greed Index of the Capital Markets today

b. INSPIRATION OF THE CREATIVE WORK
The inspiration for the work comes from a deeply transformative experience I had when I was 18-19 years old. The so-called 'Kundalini Experience' allowed me to have a natural OBE (Out of the body experience) and attain higher states of consciousness. 

After this event, my life did change forever and the messages received during this deep dive into a consciousness mark the beginning of a series of exhibitions which will describe through art such experiences in the following years. The intention is to decode the messages received and transmit them to the general public for good.

c. WORK SHOW: WHEN AND WHERE

Because the Project objective is to share the information received after attaining/traveling to higher dimensions we envision to share it in old and modern sacred spaces:

. Old traditional sacred spaces - Churches and Cathedrals
. New modern sacred spaces - Yoga centers and specific and selected art galleries
. Natural Sacred spaces - Old Indigenous spaces in Quebec and Canada.

9. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES - 250 words :
. CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT?
This work is capital to my artistic development because it's my most personal up to date. Coming from a profundly deep experience when I was a young adult, 20 years after nothing has changed. I still remember that experience as it was today. 

My artistic style has been always marked by a deep spiritual imprint. And this imprint has pushed me to the study of the main world religions from the East and West. Bringing this work to live will only make me a better artist with a clearer and remarkable personality and style.

This work expresses my deepest mystical, religious and metaphysical experiences and it's vital for me as an artist start exploring this period of my life who supports my energy as a human being and brings a positive message to the masses: The possibility of an afterlife

. ADVANCE ARTISTIC PRACTICE?
- It will deepen my knowledge in the following artistic disciplines:
1. Web Programming 
2. Generative Art Coding and mobile communication
3. Digital Printing latest technologies
4. Web Virtual Reality
5. Robotics and the Internet of Things - To see
6. Blockchain technology and crypto identity
6. Meditative practices of visualization

. WHAT TYPE OF ARTISTIC RISKS WILL YOU BE TAKING?
I will offer several ways to experience the artwork:
- Latest digital Printing in medium and large format
- 3D Printing and Holographic Projection
- Creation of a mini IOT Robot - To see
- Blockchain technology in the backend.

EXPLORING A TRADITIONAL PRACTICE IN A NEW WAY
- The website with coded Generative art pieces inspired by the main exhibit ones
- VR version of some of the pieces
- Holographic Projection

TECHNOLOGY IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY
- Creation of a Mini IOT Robot for one of the pieces
- Decentralized storage of Data

 NEW MODELS OF DISSEMINATION
 - Digital citizenship with a unique cryptographical identity number bringing individual copyright to the market through the Blockchain technology. 
- Introduction of the workart into the new decentralized blockchain Market

10. HOW WILL YOUR ACTIVITIES BUILD INTEREST IN AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE? ARE YOUR ACTIVITIES TARGETED TO A SPECIFIC PUBLIC?

My project goes in the lines of contemporary artist who are opening a new medium which is metaphysical and trascendental at the same time. Visionaries like Alex Grey,and Adolph Turner opened a connection to other artsits who have experienced other worlds with artifical altered states or natural ones like is my case. 

Exist a bigger and bigger community of individuals who care for a better health, a better environment and a better and deeper human relationship. All these individual who are reintroducing to their daily lives ancient techniques like Yoga and Meditation are the public that can be supportive at first sight. 

At the same time the Project, although coming from the Metaphysics, dives into modern contemporary art world and puts itself at the forefront of new web technologies like webVR, generative art and the use of modern blockchain technologies for the backend encrypted records. This will atract also the classic contemporary art based in new technologies.

11. IF YOU ARE HIRING ARTISTS, EXPLAIN HOW YOU DETERMINE THE FEES TO BE PAID 
- 250 words - See if I want to introduce this part or...not. All by myself?

I will hire an artist who will help me to build: - To see

1- Mini IOT robot - I could build it just in code and in p5js or webVR
2- Massive Cylinder in the Center - I can look for support to project Holographic images inside a Cylinder.

His fees will be 25$/h and will work in paralel with me during 6 months

12. HOW WILL ENSURE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS? - 100 words
In his case he has a lab and is professional in physics 

13. DOES NOT TOUCH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DIRECTLY BUT COULD BE PRESENTED IN ONE OF THEIR SITES

It is not the case.

14. DISTRIBUTION - EXHIBITION - DISSEMINATION - PROMOTION - PLANS

The project will be on the web stored in the EOS Blockchain in a descentralized system. Each of the pieces will be ecrypted and sold in crytpocurrencies as payment method. The payments and shipping will be handled through the website. 

It will be promoted throught the SAT, GESU and other knowh Montreal Art Centers. 

My intention is to do the presentation in a church when possible and have a permanent exhibition there and another rotating different churches in Quebec, Canada and the World.

15. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE?

1- EOS tokens to use the super decenteralized computer
2- Technology to Project in 3D
3- Programming skills
