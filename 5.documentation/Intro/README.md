## Introduction
**Out of the Body: Experiences** presents 10 artworks reflecting my personal understanding on different 
'Out of the Body Experiences' / OBE I had at a young age. These experiences made a profound impact in myself and made me live and see life in a different way. After many years studing different religions, investigating and decoding them here I present some conclusions on the messages I did receive during these deep experiences. I concentrate mainly in the 'topology of suffering' in this human life.
