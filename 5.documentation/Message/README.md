## Message
**304:Experiences Out of the Body** presents 10 artworks reflecting my personal understanding on different 
'Out of the Body Experiences' / OBE I had at a young age. These experiences made a profound impact in myself and made me live and see life in a different way. After many years of study, investigation and decoding here I present some conclusions on the messages I did receive during these deep experiences.

The Exhibition will be built around a central piece called 'the message'. This human size central piece it's a cylinder made of LED's. This piece will be built and programmed by a small team of artists.

Surrounding this piece we will present 'the Conclusions'. Each of the 9 pieces explore a different **view** on the message received.

The 9 pieces will be connected with LED lights to the center LED central cylindrical piece. 

The exhibition presents a concrete body of information with a positive message and profound questions such as:
1. **In which energy level do we live?**
2. **Are we able to recognize the fear-greed dimension we leave in?**
3. **Are we able to percieve a deeper level made of lov-compaaion inside us?**
5. **What is the Kundalini energy?**
6. **Is Death a Myth?**
7. **Does consioussness still alive after leaving the body?**
8. **What does the cylindrical form mean to us humans?**
9. **How should we approach the last moments od our lives?**
